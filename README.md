# crapGoService
a really really really crap Go service with no sense at all. Just trying my best to learning and keeping fun for myself

##How to Run

1. First you need to know that i don't know what i'm doing.
2. You need to have go instaled in your machine: https://golang.org/doc/install
3. You need docker with a mysql image installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
4. run this command in the terminal: docker run -p 3306:3306 --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mysql
5. create a schame called "truck" : CREATE SCHEMA truck
6. create a table hello: CREATE TABLE hello(melancia varchar(255), gatinha varchar(255), picole varchar(255))
7. run in the project root: go run .
8. Open your request manager thing-magingy and start making requests..........
9. i don't know, have some fun
10. Don't ask me why the hell the service is called player-leaderboard. Just go with it (trust me, dont even remember anymore)
